    "##### Example Mutual Information being degraded by noise\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple simulation illustrates how the mutual information between two random variables $ X $ and $ Y $ decays as their relationship is disturbed by noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Scenario\n",
    "- $ X $: A random variable drawn from a normal distribution.\n",
    "- $ Y $: A noisy version of $ X $, where the noise level determines the correlation between $ X $ and $ Y $.\n",
    "- Mutual information is calculated for different levels of noise using estimation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Method\n",
    "1. Generate $ X $ from a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "2. Create $ Y $ as $ Y = X + \\text{noise} $, where the \"noise\" is a Gaussian random variable. The width of the Gaussian is varied.\n",
    "3. Use `mutual_info_regression` from scikit-learn to estimate the mutual information \\( I(X; Y) \\).\n",
    "4. Plot the mutual information as a function of noise level.\n",

    "To see how the ideas of entropy reduction and information work in a real example,  let’s consider the response of a neuron to sensory inputs (for more, see Bialek's book, Ch. 6.2 {cite}`bialek2012biophysics` and the original paper published in PRL{cite}`strong1998entropy`). \n",
    "Figure 6.5 shows the results of experiments on the motion-sensitive neuron H1 in the fly visual system. In these experiments, a fly sees a randomly moving pattern,  and H1 responds with a stream of spikes. If we fix $\\Delta \\tau = 3$ms nd look at $T = 30$ ms  segments of the spike train, there are $2^{T /\\Delta \\tau} \\sim 10^3$ possible words, but the distribution is biased, and the entropy is only $S(T, \\Delta \\tau)\\sim$ 5 bits $ <\\log_2(10^3)\\sim 10$ bits. This relatively low entropy  means that we can still sample the distributions of words even out to $T \\sim 50−60$ ms,  which is interesting, because the fly can actually generate a flight correction in response  to visual motion inputs within $\\sim 30$ ms. \n",

    "$$ I(\\text{Words;time in movie})= S(\\text{Words})-\\langle S(\\text{Words| time in movie}) \\rangle_{\\text{time}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "vs $S(\\text{Words})$ as a measure for how much information per second the spike trains encode about the the time stamp in the movie. The idea is that this gives an estimate of the information encoded about the entire sensory input (for which the time stamp is just a proxy). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As the time resolution $\\Delta \\tau$ is varied from 800 ms down to 2 ms,  the information rate follows the entropy rate $S(\\text{Words})$, with a nearly constant 50% efficiency.  This result was influential because it suggests that neurons are making use of a significant fraction of their capacity in actually encoding sensory signals. Also, this is true even at millisecond time resolution. The  idea that the entropy of the spike train sets a limit to neural information transmission  emerged almost immediately after Shannon’s work, but it was never clear whether these limits could be approached by real systems. \n",
